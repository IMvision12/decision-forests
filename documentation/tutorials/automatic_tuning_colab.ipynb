        "Welcome to the **Automated hyper-parameter tuning** tutorial. In this colab, you will learn how to improve your models using automated hyper-parameter tuning with TensorFlow Decision Forests.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "A learning algorithm trains a machine learning model on a training dataset. The parameters of a learning algorithm\u0026ndash;called \"hyper-parameters\"\u0026ndash;control how the model is trained and impact its quality. Therefore, finding the best hyper-parameters is an important stage of modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some hyper-parameters are simple to configure. For example, increasing the number of trees (`num_trees`) in a random forest increases the quality of the model until a plateau. Therefore, setting the largest value compatible with the serving constraints (more trees means a larger model) is a valid rule of thumb. However, other hyper-parameters have a more complex interaction with the model and cannot be chosen with such a simple rule. For example, increasing the maximum tree depth (`max_depth`) of a gradient boosted tree model can both increase or decrease the quality of the model. Furthermore, hyper-parameters can interact between each others, and the optimal value of a hyper-parameter cannot be found in isolation.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three main approaches to select the hyper-parameter values:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The default approach**: Learning algorithms come with default values. While not ideal in all cases, those values produce reasonable results in most situations. This approach is recommended as the first approach to use in any modeling. [This page](https://github.com/google/yggdrasil-decision-forests/blob/main/documentation/learners.md) lists the default value of TF Decision Forests.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **The template hyper-parameter approach**: In addition to the default values, TF Decision Forests also exposes the hyper-parameter templates. Those are benchmark-tuned hyper-parameter values with excellent performance but high training cost (e.g. `hyperparameter_template=\"benchmark_rank1\"`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **The manual tuning approach:** You can manually test different hyper-parameter values and select the one that performs best. [The advanced users guide](https://github.com/google/yggdrasil-decision-forests/blob/main/documentation/user_manual.md#manual-tuning-of-hyper-parameters) give some advice.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **The automated tuning approach:** A tuning algorithm can be used to find automatically the best hyper-parameter values. This approach gives often the best results and does not require expertise. The main downside of this approach is the time it takes for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this colab, we shows the **default** and **automated tuning** approaches with the TensorFlow Decision Forests library.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hyper-parameter tuning algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "Automated tuning algorithms work by generating and evaluating a large number of hyper-parameter values. Each of those iterations is called a \"trial\". The evaluation of a trial is expensive as it requires to train a new model each time. At the end of the tuning, the hyper-parameter with the best evaluation is used. \n",
        "\n",
        "Tuning algorithm are configured as follow:\n",
        "\n",
        "**The search space**\n",
        "\n",
        "The search space is the list of hyper-parameters to optimize and the values they can take. For example, the maximum depth of a tree could be optimized for values in between 1 and 32. Exploring more hyper-parameters and more possible values often leads to better models but also takes more time. The hyper-parameters listed in the [user manual](https://github.com/google/yggdrasil-decision-forests/blob/main/documentation/user_manual.md#manual-tuning-of-hyper-parameters) are the most impactful ones to tune. The other hyper-parameters are listed in the [documentation](https://github.com/google/yggdrasil-decision-forests/blob/main/documentation/learners.md).\n",
        "\n",
        "When the possible value of one hyper-parameter depends on the value of another hyper-parameter, the search space is said to be conditional.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The number of trials**\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of trials defines how many models will be trained and evaluated. Larger number of trials generally leads to better models, but takes more time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The optimizer**\n",
        "\n",
        "The optimizer selects the next hyper-parameter to evaluate the past trial evaluations. The simplest and often reasonable optimizer is the one that selects the hyper-parameter at random.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The objective / trial score**\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective is the metric optimized by the tuner. Often, this metric is a measure of quality (e.g. accuracy, log loss) of the model evaluated on a validation dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Train-valid-test*\n",
        "\n",
        "The validation dataset should be different from the training datasets: If the training and validation datasets are the same, the selected hyper-parameters will be irrelevant. The validation dataset should also be different from the testing dataset (also called holdout dataset): Because hyper-parameter tuning is a form of training, if the testing and validation datasets are the same, you are effectively training on the test dataset. In this case, you might overfit on your test dataset without a way to measure it.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Cross-validation*\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of a small dataset, for example a dataset with less than 100k examples, hyper-parameter tuning can be coupled with [cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)): Instead of being evaluated from a single training-test round, the objective/trial score is evaluated as the average of the metric over multiple cross-validation rounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly as to the train-valid-and-test datasets, the cross-validation used to evaluate the objective/score during hyper-parameter tuning should be different from the cross-validation used to evaluate the quality of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Out-of-bag evaluation*\n",
        "\n",
        "Some models, like Random Forests, can be evaluated on the training datasets using the \"out-of-bag evaluation\" method. While not as accurate as cross-validation, the \"out-of-bag evaluation\" is much faster than cross-validation and does not require a separate validation datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "*In tensorflow decision forests*\n",
        "\n",
        "In TF-DF, the model [\"self\" evaluation](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/tutorials/beginner_colab#model_self_evaluation\n",
        ") is always a fair way to evaluate a model. For example, an out-of-bag evaluation is used for Random Forest models while a validation dataset is used for Gradient Boosted models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hyper-parameter tuning with TF Decision Forests\n",
        "\n",
        "TF-DF supports automatic hyper-parameter tuning with minimal configuration. In the next example, we will train and compare two models: One trained with default hyper-parameters, and one trained with hyper-parameter tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Hyper-parameters tuning can take a long time in the case of large datasets. In this case, it is recommended to use TF-DF with distributed training to drastically speed-up the hyper-parameter tuning."
